                ParkingPlan is created by Evgeniy Ivlev. I'm a programmer from Montreal. I've created this software
                to avoid paying parking tickets unnecessarily.<br>

                This is the first release of this software. Further releases will include features such as:
                address interpolation, votings, comments, reminders and generally changes for the better incurred
                from your feedback and my own experience in using this app.<br>
                <div>
                    <h3>The app works for the following cities:</h3>
